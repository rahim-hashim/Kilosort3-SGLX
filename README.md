## Dependencies

Requirements:

* Anaconda installed on computer

* [Kilosort-3](https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort)

* [phy2](https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy)

* [SpikeGLX CatGT and TPrime](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/)

* [SpikeGLX_Datafile_Tools](https://github.com/jenniferColonell/SpikeGLX_Datafile_Tools) (MATLAB tools required)



## Setup

> Setup for Kilosort-3 is identical to what has been outlined in the original [repository](https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort). This script will not work without Kilosort installed properly. [CatGT](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/help/catgt_tshift/catgt_tshift/) is also embedded in this repository under the directory CatGT-win, and [TPrime ](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/help/syncEdges/Sync_edges/)is required in order to align all imec probes . 
> 
> Lastly, make sure to setup the [phy](https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy/) virtual environment appropriately in order to run extract-waveforms, which also relies on [Anaconda](www.anaconda.org) to also be installed on your computer.
